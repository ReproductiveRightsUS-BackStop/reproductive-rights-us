                        <p>Reproductive health care, including access to birth control and safe and legal abortion care, is an essential
                            part of your health and well-being. While Roe v. Wade was overturned, abortion remains legal in many states,
                            and other reproductive health care services remain protected by law. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is committed to providing you with accurate and up-to-date information about
                            access to and coverage of reproductive health care and resources. Our goal is to make sure you have appropriate information and support.

                <p>
                    Below you will find information on your right to access reproductive health care, what your health insurance is required to cover,
                    and where to go if you need health insurance.

                <p>
                    Whether you get coverage through your employer, Medicaid, HealthCare.gov, or elsewhere in the private insurance market, most plans
                    cover family planning counseling, birth control, and other preventive services at no additional cost to you. Federal law allows federally-funded
                    health coverage (like Medicaid) to cover abortion in some situations, and some private health insurance plans also cover abortion care.
