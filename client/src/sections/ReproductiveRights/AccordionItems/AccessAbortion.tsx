            <p>
                As a result of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, access to abortion will depend on the state you live in even more than before.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Mifepristone, in a regimen with misoprostol, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2000 for the termination of early pregnancy,
                and is safe and effective when used as directed. Mifepristone for medication abortion currently is available for dispensing by mail by certified prescribers or
                by certified pharmacies for prescriptions issued by certified prescribers, in addition to in-person dispensing in clinics, medical offices, and hospitals.</p>

            <p>If you are covered through Medicaid:</p>

                <li className="p-2">
                    While federal Medicaid funds can only cover abortion in the circumstances of rape, incest or if the patient’s life is in danger, there are over a dozen states that
                    provide more comprehensive coverage for abortion using state Medicaid funds. To find out more on state funding of abortions under Medicaid visit this website

            <br />
            <p>If you are covered through your employer, a plan offered through the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces, or elsewhere in the private market:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc m-3">
                <li className="p-2">
                    Coverage will vary by state, employer, and insurance company. In some states, private health insurance plans (including employer coverage)
                    are required or allowed to cover abortion in either all or certain circumstances. Review your plan benefits document to find out whether your plan
                    covers abortion. If you are using a plan where you are not the primary policy holder (for example if you are on a parent’s or spouse’s plan), be mindful
                    that the policy holder may receive documentation from the plan known as an “Explanation of Benefits” that includes information about your care.
