            <p>The law prohibits pharmacies that receive federal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin,
                sex, age, and disability in their health programs and activities.While pharmacies regularly dispense medications;
                make determinations regarding the suitability of a prescribed medication for a patient; and advise patients about medications and how to take them,
                pharmacies that receive federal financial assistance may not discriminate against pharmacy customers on the bases prohibited by statute when they do so.
